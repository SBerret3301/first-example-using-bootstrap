Explanation:

1. **Title Modification:**
   - The title of the document is changed to "Bootstrap Page Example."

2. **Bootstrap CSS Link:**
   - The `<link>` tag is included to link the Bootstrap CSS file (`bootstrap.css`).

3. **Containers:**
   - Three container `<div>` elements are used to demonstrate Bootstrap styling.
   - Bootstrap classes like `container`, `p-5`, `my-5`, `bg-dark`, `text-white`, etc., are used for styling.

4. **Comments:**
   - Comments are added to the code for better understanding of each section and Bootstrap class used.

Note: Make sure to replace "bootstrap.css" with the correct path to your Bootstrap CSS file. If Bootstrap is not locally available, you can use a CDN link like `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">`.
